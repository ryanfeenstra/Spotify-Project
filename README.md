# Spotify-Project

The aim of the project was to use machine learning to determine which features of a song are significant in predicting the amount of streams a song will get. The data was collected from a public dataset on Kaggle that contained a plethora of aspects of a song, including factors like danceability, vakence, loudness, etc. A variety of models were applied to the data including linear models, elastic net, lasso, and ridge. All models were compared using RMSE to determine which model could predict streams the best.
